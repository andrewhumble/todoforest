= SPEC-001: Hierarchical Todo List Web App
:sectnums:
:toc:

== Background

This web app is designed to facilitate better organization of tasks in a hierarchical structure. By allowing users to structure their todo lists as trees, it enables a more granular breakdown of larger tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks while maintaining an overview of the larger project or goal. This structure is particularly beneficial for agile development work, offering a visual and interactive mind map of tasks that can enhance productivity and task management. However, the app is not limited to agile development and can be beneficial to any user requiring advanced organization capabilities for their todo lists.

== Requirements

*Must have:*

- Hierarchical structuring of todo lists allowing for tasks and subtasks to be easily organized and visualized.
- User authentication system to enable personal and secure access to todo lists.
- Database storage for persistent, reliable storage of todo lists, tasks, and their hierarchical relationships.
- Minimalistic animations to enhance user interaction without causing distractions or performance issues.
- Drag-and-drop functionality for intuitive reorganization of tasks and subtasks within the tree structure.

*Should have:*

- Responsive design to ensure accessibility and usability across various devices and screen sizes.
- Real-time updates to todo lists to reflect changes across all user devices instantly.

*Could have:*

- Sharing capabilities to allow teams to collaborate on a shared todo list.
- Integration with calendar applications for deadline tracking and reminders.

*Won't have (for now):*

- Complex gamification elements.
- Third-party integrations beyond calendar applications.

== Method

=== Architecture Overview

The web app will leverage React for the frontend, with Next.js facilitating server-side rendering and routing. For UI components and styling, Mantine will ensure a modern, responsive design. MongoDB will be used for storing the hierarchical todo lists, complemented by a backend likely implemented in Node.js for seamless integration.

=== Database Schema

MongoDB's document-based storage model is ideal for the app's hierarchical todo lists, structured as follows:

[source,json]
----
{
  "_id": ObjectId(),
  "owner": "user_id",
  "title": "Todo List Title",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "taskId": ObjectId(),
      "title": "Task Title",
      "description": "Task Description",
      "status": "pending|completed",
      "subTasks": [
        // Subtasks replicate the parent task structure
      ]
    }
  ],
  "createdAt": "ISODate()",
  "updatedAt": "ISODate()"
}
----

This flexible schema supports tasks and subtasks nested within lists, ideal for complex task hierarchies.

=== Drag-and-Drop Functionality

For drag-and-drop interactions, we'll utilize `pragmatic-drag-and-drop`, a library chosen for its flexibility and ease of integration with React. This will enable intuitive reordering of tasks and subtasks, enhancing the user experience by making task management more interactive and efficient.

=== Animations

For animations, we'll primarily rely on GSAP, renowned for its performance and flexibility in creating complex, high-quality animations. This choice allows us to enhance the app's visual appeal and user feedback without compromising on performance. Minimalistic animations will be integrated into drag-and-drop interactions and task completion actions, using GSAP for any additional animation needs outside of what `pragmatic-drag-and-drop` provides.

== Implementation

=== Phase 1: Project Setup and Backend Foundations

1. Initialize the project repository with Next.js, setting up ESLint and Prettier for code quality.
2. Set up the Node.js backend environment, integrating Express for API routing.
3. Connect the backend to MongoDB using Mongoose for schema definition and database management.
4. Implement user authentication:
   - Set up a User model in MongoDB.
   - Integrate Passport.js or a similar library for handling user authentication.
   - Create registration and login endpoints, including session management and token issuance (JWT).

=== Phase 2: Real-time Data and API Development

1. Implement WebSocket or use a service like Pusher for real-time updates to todo lists.
2. Develop RESTful APIs for todo list management (CRUD operations for lists, tasks, and subtasks).
3. Ensure authentication is enforced on all relevant endpoints.

=== Phase 3: Frontend Development and UI Design

1. Set up React context or a state management library (e.g., Redux or Zustand) for global state management.
2. Integrate Mantine for UI components, focusing on responsive design principles.
3. Develop components for:
   - User registration and login.
   - Todo list creation, viewing, editing, and deletion.
   - Task manipulation (add, edit, delete) within lists.

=== Phase 4: Drag-and-Drop Functionality and Animations

1. Implement `pragmatic-drag-and-drop` for interactive task management within lists.
   - Ensure that drag-and-drop updates are reflected in the database in real-time.
2. Use GSAP for adding animations to:
   - Task reordering.
   - UI feedback for task completion and deletion.
   - Entry and exit animations for modal dialogs.

=== Phase 5: Testing, Optimization, and Deployment

1. Write unit and integration tests for both backend and frontend, using Jest and React Testing Library.
2. Perform end-to-end testing with Cypress to ensure the app works seamlessly on various devices and browsers.
3. Optimize performance, focusing on minimizing re-renders in React and optimizing database queries.
4. Set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
5. Deploy the app to a cloud service (e.g., Vercel for Next.js apps) with environment variables and secure storage for sensitive data like database credentials.
